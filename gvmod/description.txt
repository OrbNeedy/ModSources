Gunvolt Mod aims to create an experience based on the Gunvolt series.

Septimas
A power every player has, you get a different one at random each time you load.
You can get:
Azure Striker: A septima that right now, only allows the usage of a flashfield, which will damage enemies constantly, but be careful, you will overheat underwater.
Azure Thunderclap: The same as Azure Striker, but stronger overall, and can also damage friendly NPCs, it has the same weakness.

Every time you use a septima, you use up some sp, and if it reaches 0, you won't be able to use it until you cool down.
Check mod controls, it's important.

Multiplayer not supported.
